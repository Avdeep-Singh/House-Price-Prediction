# House Price Prediction Model

This project implements a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features in a dataset. It can be used to estimate the value of a house based on its characteristics.

## Data Exploration

The project utilizes a dataset named `Delhi.csv` containing information about houses in Delhi (replace with details about your data source if applicable). Visualization with histograms helps explore the distribution of numerical features in the dataset.
## Data Cleaning and Pre-processing

- **Column Renaming:** Certain column names were renamed for clarity (e.g., `No. of Bedrooms` to `Bedrooms`).
- **Label Encoding:** Categorical features like `Location` were converted into numerical values using a `LabelEncoder` from `sklearn.preprocessing`. This is necessary for most machine learning algorithms that require numerical features.

## Feature Correlation (Commented Out)

The commented-out section (`corr_matrix = housing.corr(); print(corr_matrix["Price"].sort_values(ascending=False))`) calculates the correlation matrix and displays the features most correlated with `Price`. This information can be helpful in identifying potentially important features for prediction.

## Target Variable Transformation

The house price (`Price`) usually has a skewed distribution. Taking the logarithm of the price helps normalize the distribution and improve model performance. The code uses `np.log` to achieve this.

## Feature Selection and Missing Value Handling (Commented Out)

- **Feature Selection:** The code currently includes all features. Feature selection techniques can be explored to identify the most relevant features and potentially improve model performance.
- **Missing Value Handling:** The commented-out lines (`housing.replace(9,np.nan,inplace=True)`, `housing.dropna(axis=0,how="any",inplace=True)`) attempt to handle missing values. Different strategies (e.g., imputation, removal) can be evaluated depending on the data and modeling approach.

## Model Training and Evaluation

**1. Train-Test Split:** The data is split into training and testing sets using `sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split`. The training set (80%) is used to train the model, and the testing set (20%) is used to evaluate its performance on unseen data.

**2. Feature Scaling:** Feature scaling using `StandardScaler` from `sklearn.preprocessing` is applied to normalize the features and improve the performance of some machine learning algorithms.

**3. Linear Regression Model:**

- A Linear Regression model (`LinearRegression` from `sklearn.linear_model`) is trained on the scaled training data.
- The model's performance on the testing set is evaluated using `R-squared` (`lin_reg.score(X_test, y_test)`).
- The code also plots the predicted vs. actual price values to visually assess the model's fit.

**4. Evaluation Metrics:**

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are calculated using `sklearn.metrics` to quantify the model's prediction errors.

**5. Additional Model (Commented Out):**

- The code includes a commented-out section for training a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model with a linear kernel (`SVR(kernel='linear')`). You can experiment with different models and compare their performance.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a basic approach to house price prediction using machine learning. The model achieves an R-squared score of `[insert R-squared value]` on the testing set, indicating a moderate ability to predict house prices based on the provided features. Further improvements can be achieved through:

- Feature selection techniques
- Exploring different machine learning models
- Experimenting with hyperparameter tuning
- Using a larger and more comprehensive dataset

## Disclaimer

House prices are influenced by various factors beyond the scope of this project. The model's predictions should be used as an estimate and may not be perfectly accurate.
